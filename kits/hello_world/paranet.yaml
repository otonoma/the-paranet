# This file represents a "paranet package". A package is a collection of actors, panels, sidecars, and model
# files. This package represents "your paranet" - all of your actors are defined here for deployment to a
# node. A package can be deployed to multiple nodes or imported into other packages. Most commonly for
# development you will have one package per node.
#
# Below we will briefly explain the most common fields you will see or use in a package.
# Many additional fields exist to further configure actors or the package. For a full reference, see [...TODO]
