# the-paranet
The Paranet is a distributed network where actors (software agents, hardware wrappers, humans, or nodes) communicate via skills to achieve goals. As a developer, you build actors using Paraflow, which defines workflows through goals, events, rules, and tasks. Actors register on Paranet nodes, enabling real-time collaboration.
