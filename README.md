**The Paranet** is a distributed federated network architecture designed for the next generation of autonomous systems. It enables entities to host **Nodes** that speak a common communication protocol, hosting **Actors** that perform complex tasks through a dynamic **Skill** brokering system.

## 🌐 Overview

The Paranet isn't just a communication layer; it's a living ecosystem of intelligence. By decoupling logic (Actors) from hosting (Nodes) and discovery (Skills), we’ve created a network that is resilient, scalable, and truly interoperable.

### Core Architecture Concepts:
* **Nodes:** The foundational runtime. Anyone can host a node to provide compute and connectivity to the network.
* **Actors:** Autonomous entities residing on nodes. They are the "doers" of the Paranet.
* **Skills:** Functional capabilities that Actors possess. The network brokering system allows nodes to find and utilize skills across the federation.
* **Federation:** Nodes securely connect and share skill registries, creating a unified global network of capabilities.
